# Quantitative-Analysis-of-ChatGPT-s-Efficacy-in-Software-Debugging-Prompts
Quantitative Analysis of ChatGPT's Efficacy in Software Debugging Prompts using DevGPT Dataset.

This project entails a comprehensive analysis of ChatGPT's efficiency in addressing software debugging prompts. Utilizing a rich dataset from DevGPT, including GitHub issues, commits, and discussion sections, the study uncovers extensive usage of ChatGPT in software debugging contexts. We execute sentiment analysis on issue descriptions, revealing insights into the emotional tone of these interactions. Additionally, the project calculates the average resolution times across various programming languages, highlighting the differences in debugging complexities. The correlation between resolution times and programming languages is also explored, providing valuable metrics on how programming language complexity impacts debugging efficacy. This analysis offers a nuanced understanding of ChatGPT's role and effectiveness in software debugging, serving as a critical resource for developers and researchers in AI-enhanced programming environments and further help in enhancing future versions of ChatGPT.
