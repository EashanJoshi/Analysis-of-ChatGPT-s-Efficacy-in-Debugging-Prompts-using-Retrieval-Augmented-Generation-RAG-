Quantitative Analysis of ChatGPT's Efficacy in Software Debugging Prompts using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
This project focuses on enhancing ChatGPT’s effectiveness in debugging by implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. By dynamically retrieving relevant debugging resources and integrating them into ChatGPT’s responses, the project addresses critical limitations such as generic interactions and inefficient bug localization.

The analysis uses the DevGPT dataset, which comprises GitHub issues, commits, and discussion threads, to examine ChatGPT’s performance in real-world debugging scenarios. Sentiment analysis reveals the emotional tone of issue descriptions, while resolution times are analyzed across programming languages, highlighting differences in debugging complexity and ChatGPT’s adaptability when augmented with RAG.

How RAG Was Applied:
Dynamic Retrieval of Debugging Context:
ChatGPT was augmented with a retrieval layer to fetch relevant error documentation, prior discussions, and code examples dynamically. This ensured that responses were precise and contextually relevant.

Integration into Interactions:
Retrieved resources were seamlessly incorporated into ChatGPT's responses, enabling more targeted and actionable solutions for debugging challenges.

Multi-Turn Dialogue Optimization:
RAG enhanced ChatGPT’s ability to maintain context over multiple interactions by dynamically updating its responses based on new retrievals, ensuring progressively refined solutions.

Findings:
Improved Query Specificity:
With RAG, ChatGPT transitioned from generic, broad responses to specific, actionable suggestions by dynamically integrating relevant external data.

Faster Bug Localization:
RAG significantly reduced bug localization and resolution times by providing immediate access to debugging resources, enabling developers to address issues efficiently.

Language-Specific Insights:
The analysis of resolution times revealed variances across programming languages, ranging from 1 to 56 days. RAG mitigated these differences by providing tailored debugging support based on language complexity.

Impact of RAG Integration:
Increased Debugging Efficiency:
Bug resolution times were significantly reduced as ChatGPT responses became more context-aware and tailored to specific debugging scenarios.

Enhanced Developer Experience:
Developers reported more intuitive interactions, with ChatGPT providing resources directly relevant to their debugging needs.

This project demonstrates how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can transform ChatGPT into a highly effective debugging assistant. By leveraging dynamic retrieval and context integration, this approach paves the way for more reliable and efficient AI-driven programming tools.
